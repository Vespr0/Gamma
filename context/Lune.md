DESCRIPTION: Steps for publishing a new release of Lune. This includes updating the changelog, setting the version in Cargo.toml, pushing changes, triggering the release workflow, and updating the release notes.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_4

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
Make sure the changelog is up to date and contains all of the changes since the last release.
Add the release date in the changelog + set a new version number in `Cargo.toml`.
Commit and push changes from step 2 to GitHub. This will automatically publish the Lune library to [crates.io](https://crates.io) when the version number changes.
Trigger the [release](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/actions/workflows/release.yaml) workflow on GitHub manually, and wait for it to finish. Find the new pending release in the [Releases](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/releases) section.
Add in changes from the changelog for the new pending release into the description, hit "accept" on creating a new version tag, and publish üöÄ
```

TITLE: Lune FS: Write Directory
DESCRIPTION: Creates a directory and any necessary parent directories. Errors occur if the path exists as a file, or due to permission/I/O issues.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/__wiki__/API Reference - FS.md#_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
writeDir(path: string)
  Creates a directory and its parent directories if they are missing.
  Errors:
  - `path` already points to an existing file or directory.
  - Insufficient permissions to create the directory or its parents.
  - Other I/O errors.
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Create a New Place File from Scratch
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates creating a new Roblox DataModel from scratch using `Instance.new`, populating it with models and parts, and saving it to a place file. Requires the `@lune/roblox` library.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/__wiki__/Roblox.md#_snippet_2

LANGUAGE: lua
CODE:
```
local roblox = require("@lune/roblox")
local Instance = roblox.Instance

-- You can even create a new DataModel using Instance.new, which is not normally possible in Roblox
-- This is normal - most instances that are not normally accessible in Roblox can be manipulated using Lune!
local game = Instance.new("DataModel")
local workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

-- Here we just make a bunch of models with parts in them for demonstration purposes
for i = 1, 50 do
	local model = Instance.new("Model")
	model.Name = "Model #" .. tostring(i)
	model.Parent = workspace
	for j = 1, 4 do
		local part = Instance.new("Part")
		part.Name = "Part #" .. tostring(j)
		part.Parent = model
	end
end

-- As always, we have to save the DataModel (game) to a file when we're done
roblox.writePlaceFile("myPlaceWithLotsOfModels.rbxl")
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Using process.create for Interactive Process Management
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to use the new `process.create` function in Lune to spawn a child process, write data to its standard input stream, and read data from its standard output stream. This API is designed for interactive process communication and replaces the older `process.spawn` for such use cases.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: Lua
CODE:
```
local child = process.create("program", {
  "first-argument",
  "second-argument"
})

-- Writing to stdin
child.stdin:write("Hello from Lune!")

-- Reading partial data from stdout
local data = child.stdout:read()
print(data)

-- Reading the full stdout
local full = child.stdout:readToEnd()
print(full)
```

TITLE: Reporting a Bug in Lune
DESCRIPTION: Instructions for reporting bugs in the Lune project. It advises checking for existing issues on GitHub and opening a new one with detailed information, including a code sample or test case if applicable.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
Make sure the bug has not already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/issues).
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and description**, as much relevant information as possible, and if applicable, a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior.
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Contributing Features to Lune
DESCRIPTION: Guidelines for contributing new features to Lune. This involves creating an issue, discussing API design, familiarizing with the codebase and tools (mlua, StyLua, rustfmt, clippy), writing code, and submitting a pull request with tests and issue links.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_2

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
Make sure an [issue](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/issues) has been created for the feature first, so that it can be tracked and searched for in the repository history. If you are making changes to an existing feature, and no issue exists, one should be created for the proposed changes.
Any API design or considerations should first be brought up and discussed in the relevant issue, to prevent long review times on pull requests and unnecessary work for maintainers.
Familiarize yourself with the codebase and the tools you will be using. Some important parts include:
  - The [mlua](https://crates.io/crates/mlua) library, which we use to interface with Luau.
  - Any [built-in libraries](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/tree/main/src/lune/builtins) that are relevant for your new feature. If you are making a new built-in library, refer to existing ones for structure and implementation details.
  - Our toolchain, notably [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua), [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt), and [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy). If you do not use these tools there is a decent chance CI will fail on your pull request, blocking it from getting approved.
Write some code!
Open a new GitHub pull request. A pull request for a feature must include:
  - A clear and concise description of the new feature or changes to the feature.
  - Test files for any added or changed functionality.
  - A link to the relevant issue, or a `Closes #issue` line.
```

TITLE: Contributing Bug Fixes to Lune
DESCRIPTION: Steps for submitting bug fixes to Lune. This includes creating an issue, opening a pull request with a clear description of the fix, a new test file, and a link to the relevant issue.

SOURCE: https://github.com/lune-org/lune/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_1

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
Make sure an [issue](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/issues) has been created for the bug first, so that it can be tracked and searched for in the repository history. This is not mandatory for small fixes.
Open a new GitHub pull request for it. A pull request for a bug fix must include:
  - A clear and concise description of the bug it is fixing.
  - A new test file ensuring there are no regressions after the bug has been fixed.
  - A link to the relevant issue, or a `Fixes #issue` line, if an issue exists.
```
