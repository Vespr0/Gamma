Developing a game with loot boxes on Roblox requires careful consideration of the platform's policies and the various regulations in different countries. Here is a summary of the key guidelines and things a developer should know:

1. Definition of a "Loot Box" on Roblox

    Paid Random Items: A loot box is generally defined as any system where a player pays currency (either Robux directly or an in-game currency that can be purchased with Robux) to receive a randomized virtual item. This includes things like crates, chests, or gacha systems.

    "Free" Loot Boxes: If a player can obtain a randomized item as a reward for gameplay (e.g., for completing a level or defeating a monster) without any possibility of paying Robux or a purchasable currency for it, it is typically not considered a paid random item under the policy.

2. The Core Policy and Legal Concerns

    Gambling: The primary concern with loot boxes is that they can be viewed as a form of gambling, especially when real money is involved. This is why many countries have introduced legislation to regulate them, particularly in games aimed at minors.

    Regional Restrictions: Countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, and more recently, Australia and the UK, have specific laws restricting or outright banning paid loot boxes. As a developer, you must ensure that players in these regions cannot purchase "paid random items" in your game.

    No Real-World Value: Items obtained from loot boxes must not have any transferable real-world value. This means players cannot sell or trade these items for real money or for Robux outside of the official Roblox marketplace (if an official channel for that item type exists).

3. Key Responsibilities for Developers

    Use the PolicyService API: This is the most crucial tool. Roblox provides a service called PolicyService with an API function, GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync(). You should use this to check if a player has the ArePaidRandomItemsRestricted policy set to true.

    Disable Purchases: If the policy is true for a player, you must disable the ability for them to purchase loot boxes or the currency used to buy them. This means the purchase button or option should be hidden entirely for that user.

    Disclose Odds: If your loot box system can be purchased with Robux or a currency that is linked to Robux, you are required to clearly and prominently display the odds of receiving each item or rarity level. The percentages must be accurate and add up to 100%.

    Consider Alternatives for Restricted Regions: To provide a fair experience for players in countries with restrictions, you may want to offer an alternative way for them to obtain the items, such as through a rotating shop, a direct purchase option, or as a reward for free gameplay.

In summary, while loot boxes are not universally banned on Roblox, they are a heavily regulated feature. Developers must use the provided PolicyService to comply with regional laws and must be transparent about the odds if the system is monetized. For best practice and to ensure your game is compliant and accessible globally, you should be prepared to offer different monetization and item acquisition methods for players in different countries.
