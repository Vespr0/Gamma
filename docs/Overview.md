## Perfection
Perfection means doing the impossible, but sometimes impossible means: not yet accomplished…
Project Gamma will be perfection.

## The Foundation
Project Gamma will be be a sandbox fps framework, according to wikipedia:
 “A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that provides players a great degree of creativity to interact with, usually without any predetermined goal, or with a goal that the players set for themselves.”
And I absolutely agree with the definition. Let’s expand it:
“An fps sandbox game is a sandbox game with a First Person view and an emphasis on combat.”
Roblox’s unique part-based system and its emphasis on physics provide an unparalleled foundation for designing a dynamic, destructible sandbox environment. Unlike traditional triangle-based meshes in other engines—which complicate destruction, deformation, and creative experimentation—Roblox’s modular cubes and primitives offer intuitive simplicity. Parts can be seamlessly broken, reshaped, or combined, empowering players to tear structures apart, blast holes through walls, or engineer entirely new creations without the limitations of rigid, pre-modeled assets.
We can simplify the foundation in these important key points:
Sandbox element present in all features:
- First Person immersion.
- Voxels in heavy use.
- Physics based mechanics.
- Fun as the main objective, not money.

## Inspiration

### Minecraft
Minecraft is the world’s best selling game. What’s interesting about it is that it’s not the kind of game that can only be envisioned once. If the universe were to start again, we might not get Warhammer or Splatoon, but I know with absolute certainty we would get Minecraft. And what would that minecraft look like? Would it still be fantasy themed? Most definitely. The fantasy theme fits the game perfectly. Would it still have pixel art? Yes. Pixel art accompanies the voxel system beuitifully and makes for esiear modding.
What I learned from minecraft is that the sandbox genre is the most fun. Even if a game isn’t necessarily a sandbox, it needs to have small sandbox elements to be enjoyable, character customization, loudouts, unlockables, these are all sandbox elements in a way, at least according to the definition of sandbox game I mentioned.

## The Physics
The physics engine will be the backbone of the project’s interactivity. Every action, whether shooting, building, or destroying must feel grounded yet dynamic. Bullets will impart force, knocking objects backward and making (actual) holes. Explosions will create shockwaves that deform terrain, scatter debris, and propel players. Destructible environments will react organically: walls crumble into smaller parts, floors collapse under weight, and structures lean precariously before crashing down. Players can manipulate physics creatively—using objects as shields, constructing unstable traps, or hurling debris with explosives. The goal is emergent gameplay where physics isn’t just a system but a tool for experimentation.

### The Voxels
Roblox parts will be treated as dynamic voxels. Terrain and structures are built from modular cubes, allowing players to affect the world block-by-block. Unlike static meshes, these voxels can be fractured, melted, or reshaped. The simplicity of voxels ensures accessibility, while their versatility fuels creativity.

## The Look
To take advantage of the part based system all structures and terrain have to use parts. However, items, tools, functional objects aswell as entities will use traditional meshes, with a simple and smooth style that should contrast the rough edges of the voxels. More specifically all meshes have solid color or simple gradient textures.

## The Entities

Implementing regular NPCs is wasted potential, NPCs should too embrace the strengths of the framework, not just players

## Monetization

For a corporation this is the most important part, but for me, it is the last worry. Monetization is only beneficial to me, not the player, and should be put last. 

I'd say cosmetic items are a nice start.
